# Mercury

**Mercury**  is a Svelte animation library offering a declarative syntax for popular JavaScript animation tools like AnimeJS, Motion, and (soon) GSAP. Unlike other libraries, Mercury avoids custom components, using Svelte actions for native element animations.  Itâ€™s engine-agnostic, allowing developers to choose their preferred animation library without compromising functionality.  Mercury allows for seamless integration with existing Svelte features like transitions, actions, and motion, while eliminating the need for wrapper components. It also introduces layout animations and exit animations inspired by Framer Motion, all while keeping a clean and svelte-friendly syntax.
