You are more than welcome to fork the project and customize it to your own needs.  Features  Markdown-based docs**. Write docs using Markdown and Svelte components Light and dark mode**. Toggle between light and dark mode Syntax highlighting**. Code blocks are automatically highlighted SEO-friendly**. Meta tags and Open Graph support out of the box Pre-built components**.
